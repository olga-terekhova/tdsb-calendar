## TDSB_Calendar_Elementary.ipynb
An utility that marks up a list of dates in a school year with labels "Day 1", "Day 2", "Day 3", "Day 4", "Day 5". It's a fluid day numbering system in TDSB which cannot be calculated based on dates or days of week. The TDSB day numbers cycle through 5 values but they shift each time there is a holiday, a school break, or a PA day.
